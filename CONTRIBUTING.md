# Contributing guideline

First of all, thanks for contributing!!! ðŸš€

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs ðŸ¤•

Before creating bug reports, please be sure to check if a related issue already exist, the create one trying to be the most possible descriptive.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atom-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide information on how to reproduce the bug.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem. ðŸ¤“

### Code Contribution

In order to contribute to this project, fork the repository on your GitHub account, clone it and create a new branch to fix a bug or implement a new feature.

To start the project:

```bash
npm start # to watch the files with webpack
```

`./src` folder contains Gallereact component.

Use `npm link` comand in the main folder to use locally the package. Create your `create-react-app` or use the one inside the `/example` folder, inside the folder run `npm link gallereact` in order to provide the component to the app.

**Please note** that in order to be able to work with the component you need to feed it with images array (`images` prop). Currently the images in `/example` directory are fetched from Unsplash API that requires authentication. If you do not have the account/don't want to create it make sure to prepare list of images to feed the component. Prop `images` expects array of objects, with required property `image`, like this:

```javascript
const someImages = [{image: '<path-image>'}, {image: '<path-image>'} ...]
```

Once you are done and you think your code works well, submit a Pull Request.

### Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Create a descriptive pull request and, if exist, reference the related issue.
2. Follow the convention of the existing code you are working on.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
